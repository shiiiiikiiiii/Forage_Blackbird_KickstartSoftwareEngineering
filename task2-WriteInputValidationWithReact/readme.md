### Here is your task

Write input validation for email and password form.  
  
For email, you can simply use this library for validation [https://www.npmjs.com/package/email-validator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/email-validator)  
For password, please follow these requirements:

1.  Minimum of 8 characters
2.  Should contains both uppercase and lowercase letter
3.  Minimum of 1 numerical digit (0-9)
4.  Minimum of 1 special character (!@#$%^&\*, etc)

Show success message when validation passed and error message when validation failed.

For the success message, you can use existing success snackbar that is already shown in the template project every time we click the submit button (still has no logic).

For the error message, you can use error state from text-fields Material UI component [https://mui.com/components/text-fields/#validation](https://mui.com/components/text-fields/#validation)

Validation logic needs to be unit tested. You can use jest for unit testing [https://jestjs.io/](https://jestjs.io/)
