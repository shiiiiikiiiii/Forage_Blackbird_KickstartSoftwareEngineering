1.  Create react app using the create-react-app tool [https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app#quick-overview](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app#quick-overview)
2.  Commit the code, create GitHub repo using GitHub CLI
3.  Switch branch to “update\_logo”
4.  Replace existing logo with [https://www.propelleraero.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Vector.svg](https://www.propelleraero.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Vector.svg)
5.  Replace existing link with [https://www.propelleraero.com/dirtmate/](https://www.propelleraero.com/dirtmate/)
6.  Commit, then push the code
7.  Create PR from “update\_logo” to “master” branch using GitHub CLI
8.  Merge the PR using GitHub CLI _(ideally another engineer has to approve the PR before merging, but we will skip the approval step because we cannot approve our own PR)_
9.  List all commands you used in steps 1-8 on “command.sh” file

Add the link of your GitHub repository into the command.sh file `# REPO_URL <github_url>` (don’t forget to make it public repo)_._
